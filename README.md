# Amendment Radar: Strategic Brief

**Audience:** LMA Judges & Industry SMEs

---

### 1. The Pitch
Amendment Radar is the first post-execution intelligence tool that instantly translates complex, unstructured amendment documents into structured trade data and operational obligations, eliminating the "PDF stare-and-compare" bottleneck.

### 2. Primary Users & Pain Points

| User Profile | What They Do Today | What Hurts (The Bottleneck) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agency Operations** | Manually re-keys data from amendment PDFs into the loan system (WSO/LoanIQ). | **Operational Risk:** One fat-finger error on a margin grid update causes massive breaks in interest calculations. |
| **Secondary Trader** | Reads 200+ page conformed copies to assess transferability and economic changes. | **Liquidity Drag:** T+20 settlement delays because transfer restrictions or consent rights weren't immediately visible. |
| **Credit Portfolio Manager** | Updates covenant compliance spreadsheets manually after every amendment. | **Credit Risk:** Missed technical defaults or tightening of "Permitted Indebtedness" baskets due to human oversight. |

### 3. The 30-Second "Drool Moment" (Demo Flow)
1.  **Ingest:** Banker drops a raw "blackline" or amendment draft into the Radar.
2.  **Tension:** The "Analyzing" screen visualizes the AI scanning specifically for *economic* and *operational* clauses (not just spellcheck).
3.  **The Reveal:** The Dashboard lights up with "12 Material Changes Detected" (separating noise from signal).
4.  **Drill-Down:** Click "Financial Covenants" -> See the DSCR threshold shift from 1.10x to 1.25x side-by-side.
5.  **The Ledger:** Switch view to see the extracted data already formatted in a grid (Facility A Margin, Floor, Maturity) ready for export.
6.  **The Evidence:** Click "Generate Pack" to produce an audit-defensible change report attached to the trade ticket.

### 4. The 3 Killer Outputs
1.  **Material Changes Radar:** A noise-canceling dashboard that ignores formatting updates and highlights only economic (margin, maturity) and operational (covenants, reporting) shifts.
2.  **Obligation Ledger:** A structured, tabular dataset of the new deal state. This is the "Golden Source" that Ops needs to key into the system of record.
3.  **Trade-Ready Evidence Pack:** A timestamped, immutable PDF export that serves as the "Proof of Diligence" for internal audit and compliance.

### 5. Why we are NOT LMA.Automate
LMA.Automate is the "Assembly Line"—it is excellent for drafting and originating *new* deals on standard templates. Amendment Radar is the "Mechanic"—we handle the messy, real-world reality of the *secondary* market. Once a deal is signed and traded, it becomes a PDF that degrades with every amendment. We ingest the unstructured "dirty" data of legacy credit agreements and messy amendment drafts that exist outside the origination platform, bridging the gap between Legal's drafting and Ops' booking.

### 6. Commercial Value (Banker Terms)
*   **Cycle Time:** Reduces amendment processing from T+5 days to T+1 hour.
*   **Error Risk:** 99% reduction in manual transcription errors (re-keying risk).
*   **Review Workload:** Shifts Senior Associate focus from "Data Finding" to "Exception Management."
*   **Settlement Readiness:** Accelerates trade certainty by instantly surfacing transferability and consent modifications.
*   **Audit Defensibility:** Provides a systemic, reproducible audit trail for every booking decision made.
